How to Use the LM75BIMM Arduino Library

The LM75BIMM has a number of settings, which can be configured based on user requirements.
          
1.Address calling:The following command is used to call the address of LM75BIMM sensor to begin the transmission.

            lm.getAddr_LM75BIMM(LM75BIMM_0_0_1_ADDRESS);            // 0x49, 1001001
            
2.Shut down mode:The following command is used to Disable the Shut down.

            lm.setShutdown(SHUTDOWN_DISABLE);      // Disable (Power-up default)
